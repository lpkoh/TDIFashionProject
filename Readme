Attached is visualization of word embeddings for words found in titles of Amazon products under "Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry".
It is titled "wordEmbeddingsGenerated.png"
Requisite data is found under meta data of "Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry": http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/index.html

The word embeddings here are imperfect, but they do show that it is possible to learn some representation of the products based on
available information to cluster them. For example, leather is closely related to waterproof.
However, most words are still quite clustered, and indicate much area for improvement which also offers an opportunity. 
A future direction could be similarities trained of specifically fashion datasets, as well as extending similarity to phrases and 
product descriptions, and lastly tuning state of the art models in textual similarity for this task.

Attached also is visualization of some clothings from the Fashion MNIST dataset, titled "fashionMNISTVisualization.png".
Data can be downloaded directly in jupyter notebook.

Attached also is visualization of clothing from deepFashion, which has been labeled with some picture features, and then features
about the clothing itself, like what it is called, and numerical categories corresponding to attributes of the clothing. A legend 
is provided in other text files located in the document. It is titled "deepFashionGeneratedVisualization.png".
Data can be downloaded fully from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html

Overall, there are several kinds of image data, and deepFashion has high quality images with extremely rich description of images,
such as pose estimation (where the sleeve is located, for example), the quality of cloth, the type of clothing (blouse), etc.
This is a very rich and comprehensive and prelabeled dataset we can use in fashion categorization.

We attached a further image from the website, "deepFashionVisualizationWebsite.jpg", to demonstrate some of these labels on the images.

//Overall, the data is generated from TDI_dataProcessing. Some of the data is located on my local machine, due to repository storage
restrictions. Fashion MNIST, however, is runnable as it imports dataset from library.
