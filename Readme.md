# The Data Incubator
## Project Description
### Problem Statement:
Fashion inspiration today is found on social media sites like Instagram and Pinterest, but shopping is done on websites like Amazon. The transition from inspiration to shopping is often difficult, as after finding a piece of clothing, it is often difficult to locate/search for clothing of a similar nature to that. The idea is to build a feature extractor that can take in diverse input, whereby input from social media (posts, hashtags, images) can be transformed into features which then can be used in a recommendation system to recommend clothes.

This project focuses on building a text and image extractor that can work on social media posts.

## 1st Asset: Fashion images: Deepfashion, Instagram, Pinterest
To train an image to label and fashion images properly, we will use the DeepFashion data, which has over DeepFashion contains over 800,000 diverse fashion images ranging from well-posed shop images to unconstrained consumer photos. As we eventually plan to label fashion images on social media, the mix of posed shop images and unconstrained consumer photos is a good dataset to train on. Furthermore, we eventually want to test our feature extractor on social media posts, we will scrape some of these posts.
